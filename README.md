# Hi there, I'm Maciej! 👋

I'm an Informatics student, developer, and homelab enthusiast who loves diving into the world of technology.

## Currently Learning 🌱

- **Python:** I'm currently diving into Python, and I'm working on small projects, including one using Flask. Learning by doing is my approach.
- **Hugo:** I'm exploring Hugo to enhance my blogging skills. Sharing knowledge is important to me, and Hugo seems like a great tool for that.
- **Azure:** I'm venturing into Azure to expand my cloud computing knowledge and discover its capabilities.
