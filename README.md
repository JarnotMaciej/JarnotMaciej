### Hi there, I'm Maciej! 👋

I'm a Linux Engineer and Homelab enthusiast who loves turning coffee into automation scripts. I focus on building resilient infrastructure and exploring the DevOps landscape.

**🛠️ My Stack & Tools:**
* **Infrastructure:** Proxmox VE, TrueNAS, Cloud-init, OPNsense
* **Cloud:** Azure (Learning AZ-104), GCP
* **DevOps:** Docker, Prometheus, Grafana, Git (Forgejo)
* **OS:** Linux (Ubuntu/Debian), Windows Server
* **Scripting:** Bash, Python

**🔭 Currently working on:**
* Expanding my **Homelab** with strictly local services behind Cloudflare Tunnels.
* Automating VM deployment templates using Cloud-init.
* Grinding **TryHackMe** paths (Network Security & CTF).

**⚡ Fun fact:** I built my home network from scratch, including physical cabling. I know Layer 1 is real.
